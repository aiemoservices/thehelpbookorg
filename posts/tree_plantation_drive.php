            <h2>Tree Plantation Campaigns</h2>
            <p>A tree plantation drive was organised by our family, The HelpBook Foundation, on 13th October 2024 as a step toward a healthier environment. The motto of the drive was “Each One - Plant at least One.” Saplings of Neem, Peepal, Guava, Jamun, and Mango were distributed to promote greenery.</p>
            <p>Tree plantation is essential for providing oxygen, improving air quality, and reducing pollution. By planting trees, we ensure a better and safer environment for future generations.</p>
