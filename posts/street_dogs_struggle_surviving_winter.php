            <h2>Trouble Faced by Canines</h2>
            <p>During a recent bitterly cold morning, concerns arose about the plight of street dogs. Many were found chained, exposed to freezing temperatures, and lacking access to clean water or food. These conditions worsen when water freezes, leaving no drinkable sources available.</p>

            <h2>Struggles of Street Dogs in Winter</h2>
            <p>When exposed to prolonged cold, dogs face risks such as hypothermia, dehydration, and malnutrition. Symptoms of hypothermia include shivering, exhaustion, confusion, and inactivity, which can be life-threatening if not addressed.</p>

            <h2>Strategies Street Dogs Use for Survival</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Shelters:</strong> Dogs often seek refuge in abandoned buildings, under bridges, or in dense bushes.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Structures:</strong> Stray dogs may take advantage of porches, garages, or other human-made shelters for warmth.</li>
                <li><strong>Group Behavior:</strong> Dogs huddle together to conserve heat, especially during cold nights.</li>
                <li><strong>Finding Warm Spots:</strong> Strays look for areas exposed to sunlight or near heat-emitting objects like machinery or vehicles.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Placed straw-filled bags along roadsides to provide warm and comfortable sleeping spots.</li>
                <li>Fed as many street dogs as possible to ensure they had nourishment.</li>
                <li>Provided shelter for dogs unable to survive on the streets.</li>
                <li>Mobilized our team to visit various areas and assist the most vulnerable dogs.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
