            <h2>Significance of Workout</h2>

                <li><strong>Increased Metabolism:</strong> Cold temperatures enhance calorie burn as the body maintains core temperature.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Mental Health:</strong> Exercise releases endorphins, combating seasonal affective disorder and improving sleep quality.</li>
            </ul>
