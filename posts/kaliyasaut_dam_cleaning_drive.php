            <h2>Environmental Clean-Up Efforts</h2>
            <p>On Sunday, as part of the "Swachhta Hi Seva" (Cleanliness is Service) initiative in 2024, Municipal President Mr. Kishan Suryavanshi, along with members of the HelpBook Foundation and municipal sanitation workers, organized a large-scale cleanliness drive near Kaliyasot Dam in Bhopal.</p>

            <h2>Community Involvement in Cleanliness Drive</h2>
            <p>During this drive, Mr. Suryavanshi personally took part in the clean-up activities, gathering over 25 kilograms of plastic waste, polythene, and other litter from the area surrounding Kaliyasot Dam. The collected waste was then sent to processing centers for proper disposal, marking a significant step in reducing environmental pollution in the region.</p>
